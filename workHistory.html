                            Primary editor for promotional video materials. Working 
                            remotely on assigned projects while exceeding employer expectations. 
                            This job required extensive patience and focus in order to find 
                            micro and macro errors in footage to create a professional and eloquent 
                            final product that is both artistically and technically perfect.

                    <p>
                            Primary duties include repairing customer mobile 
                            devices to a high degree of accuracy as well as 
                            managing the day to day operations of the shop. This 
                            ole requires extreme attention to detail and, in a larger 
                            sense, a detail orientated person. Using and honing these 
                            skills has been largely helpful in advancing my progress in software 
                            development as it has enhanced my innate ability to problem solve 
                            and detect potentially vital errors early on.

                    <p>
                            Primary duties include managing and completing all 
                            repairs on desktop and laptop computer systems. This 
                            includes systems running both Mac OSX and Microsoft Windows 
                            based systems. Repairs include: software tuneup, hardware cleaning, 
                            OS reinstall (with and without data migration), hardware replacement 
                            for upgrade, hardware replacement for faulty/defective, and 
                            general customer interaction and teaching. The troubleshooting 
                            skills I’ve acquired while fulfilling this position have allowed 
                            me to constantly expand my knowledge base and find viable solutions 
                            for nonstandard problems. I also apply this troubleshooting technique 
                            to find solutions to any problems even if I don’t currently 
                            have the technical knowledge required.
